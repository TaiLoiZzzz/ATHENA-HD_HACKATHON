# ATHENA Platform - Super-App Micro-Economy Ecosystem

ATHENA is a comprehensive super-app platform for Sovico Group that transforms traditional reward points into tradable SOV-Tokens using blockchain technology. The platform provides a unified interface for booking flights (Vietjet), banking services (HDBank), resort accommodations, and insurance products, all while earning and trading SOV-Tokens in a P2P marketplace.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Pillars
1. **Blockchain Integration** - Hyperledger Fabric-based SOV-Token system
2. **Super-App Interface** - React Native cross-platform mobile application
3. **Unified Commerce** - Single cart checkout across multiple services
4. **P2P Marketplace** - Token trading with 1.5% transaction fees

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (Monolithic architecture)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with structured transaction data
- **Blockchain**: Hyperledger Fabric with Solidity-style smart contracts
- **Frontend**: React Native with React Navigation
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live updates
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with secure token management

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
- React Native development environment
- Android Studio or Xcode for mobile development

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Database Configuration**
```bash
# Create PostgreSQL database
createdb athena_db

# Set environment variables
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_PORT=5432
export DB_NAME=athena_db
export DB_USER=athena_user
export DB_PASSWORD=athena_password
export JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_change_in_production
```

3. **Initialize Database**
```bash
npm run setup-db
```

4. **Start Backend Server**
```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to Frontend Directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Install iOS Dependencies** (iOS only)
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

4. **Start Metro Bundler**
```bash
npm start
```

5. **Run on Device/Simulator**
```bash
# Android
npm run android

# iOS
npm run ios
```

### Blockchain Setup

1. **Initialize Hyperledger Fabric Network** (Simulated)
```bash
npm run setup-blockchain
```

Note: The current implementation includes a blockchain service simulator. In production, this would connect to a real Hyperledger Fabric network.
